# SoulSaid
Part of an assignment where I have to use Firebase to add database communication to a Unity game.

## About this game
It's more of a concept than a game in its current state. The purpose of the game is to allow the player to place and show other players' nearby messages in AR.

The biggest techniques I got to practice using in this project was:
- AR in Unity
- Firebase
- GPS

One technique and feature I didn't have enough time to implement was, adding a step counter.
I planned to use a step counter to add points to the player's account. Which the player would spend to write a message.
